# CookMaster Project

This project is still in progress.

My main goal is to work my way up to creating a functional program while learning and applying Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Along the way, I want to face challenges that require using the four pillars of OOP: abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. I believe that solving problems directly using these concepts will help me understand and retain them fully.

In the process, I am also learning about .NET, SQL Server, Entity Framework Core and related technologies such as interfaces and relational databases.

Since I am using macOS, which does not natively support SQL Server, this project provides a perfect opportunity to learn and practice using Docker.
